# Cards Trick Simulation - python
### Idea
This trick I learnt when I was young. I liked to turn it into a simple game in python. The code generates a random list and you can pick a number or a word and save it your mind. When the number appears the user should enter the group that the number was in it. after three tries the number will be defined based on the previous choices

### Mechanism
The generated list consists of **17** entry and they are divided on 3 groups. The groups will show up to the user, when user determines the group number the next shuffle will be based on that choice.

### Why?
This game is made for fun and as a challenge to convert cards behvaiours into python code. It was challenging in the beginning to write it. However, cracking the main problems into smaller ones helped me to write the code.
